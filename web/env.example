# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and update values as needed

# API base for browser fetches
# Default: use Next.js rewrite '/ksapi' (recommended)
#   - Keeps calls same-origin (no CORS)
#   - Avoids Windows localhost IPv6/IPv4 mismatch
# To bypass the proxy, set a full URL and prefer IPv4:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=

# Optional: Analytics or other services
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
